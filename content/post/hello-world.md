I am proud to announce that my blog is online now after some weeks of testing and tweaking theme. I have been using Facebook for some time, but found out it is not appropreate for technical topics which sometimes I would like to write down. Another reason is that I want to make myself a "personal brand". And setting up a blog is fun, too. I will try to post at least once a week. Let's see how I can manage that. Happy reading!
